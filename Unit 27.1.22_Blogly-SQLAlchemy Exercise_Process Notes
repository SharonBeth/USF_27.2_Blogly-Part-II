******************************************27.1.22-Blogly, SQLAlchemy Exercise**************************
Took the following steps, the associated commands:

1. Made a file location in WSL side for just this exercise.

2. Was not sure if I needed to manually make the Database in PostGreSQL or if that would be done based on the app.py file.
